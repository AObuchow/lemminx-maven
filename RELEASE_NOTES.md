#### Completion for nested elements in plugin configuration

LemMinX-Maven now introspects plugin definition and can provide completion for nested elements in plugin configuration.

#### Changed index location

Default index location is now `${maven.local.repository}/index` (instead of previous `${user.home}/.lemminx/maven`.

The index location can now be configured by setting its path as value of the `maven.indexLocation` element in initializationOptions, as a child of the `xml` element.
```xml
{
	"xml": {
		"maven.indexLocation": "/home/me/myIndexLocation"
	}
}
```

#### Default remote repositories now better considered

Some major bug was preventing from downloading remote artifacts from Central in some cases. This bug should now be fixed.
